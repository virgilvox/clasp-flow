### Bugs Fixed

#### 1. MediaPipe Timestamp Mismatch Error
**Problem**: When playback stopped and restarted, MediaPipe nodes (Hand, Face, Pose, Object Detection) would fail with:
```
Packet timestamp mismatch on a calculator receiving from stream "norm_rect".
Current minimum expected timestamp is 48901901 but received 22900.
```

**Root Cause**: MediaPipe requires monotonically increasing timestamps. When playback restarts, `ctx.totalTime` resets to 0, causing timestamps to go backwards.

**Fix**: Added timestamp tracking and automatic landmarker reset in `MediaPipeService.ts`:
- Track last timestamp per task type
- Detect when timestamp goes backwards significantly
- Reset landmarker when timestamp resets (playback restart)
- Ensure timestamps are always monotonically increasing

**Files Modified**: `src/renderer/services/ai/MediaPipeService.ts`

#### 2. WebcamCapture OverconstrainedError
**Problem**: Repeated `OverconstrainedError` when starting webcam capture.

**Fix**: Changed `deviceId` constraint from `exact` to `ideal` in `WebcamCapture.ts:67-85`. This prevents errors when:
- The requested device is unavailable
- The device ID is 'default'
- Device enumeration hasn't completed yet

**Files Modified**: `src/renderer/services/visual/WebcamCapture.ts`

#### 3. Build Errors (TypeScript)
Fixed multiple TS errors across files:
- **AssetBrowser.vue**: Removed unused imports (`computed`, `watch`), prefixed unused params
- **useDeviceEnumeration.ts**: Removed unused `onUnmounted` import and subscription variables
- **MediaPipeService.ts**: Fixed `InstanceType` errors with MediaPipe's private constructors
- **AudioBufferService.ts**: Fixed interface and type casting issues for Tone.js integration

### Comprehensive Audits & Fixes Completed

Five parallel audit agents analyzed the codebase and identified 68+ issues across 42 files. **All critical and high-priority memory leak issues have been fixed** (see "Resource Management Fixes" section below). Lower-priority items (type safety, validation, edge cases) are documented in "Known Issues / Future Work".

| System | Critical/High Issues | Status |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Shader | displayMaterial leak, effectShaders not disposed | **FIXED** |
| BLE/Connectivity | Event listener accumulation, BLE characteristic handlers not removed | **FIXED** |
| MediaPipe/AI | disposedNodes tracking, STT cleanup, gcAIState | **FIXED** |
| Execution Engine | GC integration, disposal calls for all executors | **FIXED** |
| 3D | CanvasTexture leak, material disposal in mesh creators, GLTF URL change leak | **FIXED** |
| Audio | GC for all state maps (beat, SVF, pitch, parametricEQ, wavetable) | **FIXED** |
| Visual | Webcam snapshot cleanup, shader material cacheKey leak | **FIXED** |

## Key Architecture

### Node System
- **Registry**: `src/renderer/registry/` - Node definitions by category
- **Executors**: `src/renderer/engine/executors/` - Runtime behavior
- **Components**: `src/renderer/components/nodes/` - Vue components
- **Engine**: `src/renderer/engine/ExecutionEngine.ts` - Graph execution

### Services
- **Audio**: `src/renderer/services/audio/` - AudioManager, AudioBufferService
- **Visual**: `src/renderer/services/visual/` - WebcamCapture, ThreeShaderRenderer
- **AI**: `src/renderer/services/ai/` - AIInference, MediaPipeService
- **Connections**: `src/renderer/services/connections/` - BLE, Serial, MIDI, OSC, etc.

### Stores
- **flows.ts**: Graph state (nodes, edges, viewports)
- **runtime.ts**: Execution state
- **ui.ts**: UI state (panels, selection)
- **assets.ts**: Asset management

## Resource Management Fixes (2026-01-19)

Following a comprehensive audit of 68+ issues across 42 files, the following resource management fixes were implemented:

### Phase 1: Core Engine Integration (`ExecutionEngine.ts`)
- Added GC calls: `gcAudioState`, `gcVisualState`, `gcCodeState`, `gc3DState`, `gcConnectivityState`, `gcAIState`, `gcNodeMetrics`
- Added disposal calls: `disposeAllCodeNodes`, `disposeAll3DNodes`, `disposeAllConnectivityNodes`, `disposeAllAINodes`
- Integrated node metrics garbage collection into graph updates

### Phase 2: Connectivity Executor (`connectivity.ts`)
- Added `midiNoteOffTimeouts` Map to track MIDI timeouts
- Added `bleCharacteristicHandlers` Map to track BLE event listeners
- Nullify WebSocket/MQTT/OSC handlers before closing connections
- Proper BLE characteristic event listener cleanup (removeEventListener + stopNotifications)
- Full `gcConnectivityState()` function for orphaned network resources

### Phase 3: AI Executor (`ai.ts`)
- Added `disposedNodes` Set to prevent async callbacks on disposed nodes
- Added `gcAIState()` for cleaning up nodeCache, pendingOperations, sttState

### Phase 4: Visual/Shader Services
- `ShaderRenderer.ts`: Fixed framebuffer cleanup order (texture before framebuffer)
- `ThreeRenderer.ts`: Explicit depth texture disposal
- `ThreeShaderRenderer.ts`: Effect shaders and display material disposal
- `visual.ts`: Webcam snapshot and pending asset loads cleanup
- `visual.ts`: Fixed duplicate shader material key leak (cacheKey cleanup)

### Phase 5: 3D Executor (`3d.ts`)
- Added `canvasTextures` Map to track Three.js CanvasTexture instances
- Updated `convertToThreeTexture()` to cache and track canvas textures
- Updated `dispose3DNode()`, `disposeAll3DNodes()`, and `gc3DState()` to properly dispose canvas textures
- Fixed material disposal in all mesh creators (box, sphere, plane, cylinder, torus) - old materials now disposed when new material is assigned
- Fixed GLTF loader URL change leak:
  - Added `loadedGLTFUrls` Map to track loaded URL per node
  - Added `disposeGLTFGroup()` helper to properly traverse and dispose geometry/materials
  - GLTF loader now detects URL changes and disposes old model before loading new one
  - Updated disposal functions to use helper and clean up URL tracking

### Phase 6: Audio Services
- `AudioBufferService.ts`: Track owned MediaStream for proper track stopping

### Phase 7: Connection Adapters
- `WebSocketAdapter.ts`: Nullify handlers before close
- `BleAdapter.ts`: Track and remove `gattserverdisconnected` listener
- `MqttAdapter.ts`: Unsubscribe from topics before dispose (using `.keys()` for Map iteration)

### Phase 8: Vue Components
- `RotaryKnob.vue`: `onUnmounted` cleanup for mouse listeners
- `FlowTabs.vue`: Context menu listener cleanup
- `EditorView.vue`: `connectionErrorTimeout` cleanup

### Phase 9: Stores
- `runtime.ts`: Added `gcNodeMetrics()` method for cleaning up metrics of deleted nodes

## Session 2026-01-19 (Continued) - Lower Priority Audit Fixes

The following lower-priority items from the audit have been fixed:

### Shader System Fixes

| Item | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Regex recompiled every call | **FIXED** - Moved `UNIFORM_REGEX` and `BUILT_IN_UNIFORMS` to module-level constants |
| Animation frame cleanup edge case | **FIXED** - Added `isUnmounted` flag to prevent callbacks after unmount |
| No actual debounce implemented | **FIXED** - Added 300ms debounce to `handleCodeChange()` with proper cleanup |

### 3D System Fixes

| Item | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Hardcoded 512x512 texture dimensions | **FIXED** - Added optional `width`/`height` parameters to `convertToThreeTexture()` |

### Audio System Fixes

| Item | Fix |
|------|-----|
| `autoCorrelate()` mutates input buffer | **FIXED** - Now copies to `processed` array before modifying |
| SVF drive toggle cleanup | **FIXED** - Properly disposes drive node when amount changes from >0 to 0 |
| Parametric EQ chain cleanup | **FIXED** - Added explicit chain disconnection in `disposeParametricEq()` |
| Oscillator volume no bounds | **FIXED** - Added `-96 dB` to `+6 dB` clamping |

---

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Remaining Audit Items (Lower Priority)

**Shader System (`ShaderPresets.ts`, `ShaderEditorModal.vue`):**
- `samplerCube` not distinguished from `sampler2D` in type system
- Default value inference is name-based and fragile (e.g., "collideDamage" treated as color)

**3D System (`3d.ts`):**
- Group node clones objects instead of sharing geometry (memory inefficient for repeated meshes)

**Audio System (`audio.ts`):**
- Audio player state not fully reset on failed load (player reference persists)

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Race Conditions**: Graph updates and model loading have potential races (partially mitigated)
2. **Cache Size Limits**: Consider adding LRU eviction for unbounded caches (`textureDataCache`, `canvasTextureCache`)
3. **Error Handling**: Some error paths could be more robust with proper logging
4. **Type Safety**: Several unsafe `as` casts in executors could use runtime validation
