# CLASP Flow

**The Ultimate Creative Flow Programming Engine**

CLASP Flow is an open-source visual flow/node programming environment that combines the best of TouchDesigner, PureData, Max/MSP, and Node-RED. Build complex audio-visual pipelines, IoT integrations, AI workflows, and interactive experiences through an intuitive node-based interface.

Built with Vue 3 + TypeScript. Runs in the browser and as a desktop app (Electron).

## Features

### Visual Programming
- Intuitive node-based editor with Vue Flow
- Type-safe connections with color-coded data types
- Real-time value inspection and monitoring
- Animated connection lines showing data flow
- Collapsible nodes for complex flows
- Mini-map navigation and zoom controls

### Audio
- Audio input from microphone/devices
- Real-time audio analysis (levels, frequency bands)
- Beat detection and BPM extraction
- Full synthesizer capabilities (oscillators, envelopes, filters)
- Effects processing (delay, reverb, distortion)
- Powered by Tone.js and Meyda.js

### Video & Shaders
- Webcam capture and video file playback
- GLSL shader editor with Shadertoy compatibility
- Automatic uniform detection
- Video effects and filters
- Video encoding/decoding via ffmpeg.wasm

### AI Integration
- Browser-based ML with Transformers.js
- Text generation, speech-to-text, image classification
- Run models locally - no server required
- Custom ONNX model support

### Connectivity
- HTTP/REST requests
- WebSocket connections
- MQTT for IoT
- MIDI input/output
- Serial port (Chrome/Electron)
- Bluetooth LE
- OSC (Electron)

### Code Nodes
- JavaScript function nodes with sandboxed execution
- Google Blockly integration for visual coding
- Custom WASM binary execution
- Expression evaluator for quick math

### Platform Support
- **Web**: Runs in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Desktop**: Full-featured Electron app with native hardware access
- Smart platform detection - nodes adapt to available capabilities

## Custom Nodes

Drop custom nodes into the `custom-nodes/` folder (Electron) or configure a custom nodes directory in settings.

```
custom-nodes/
└── my-node/
    ├── definition.json    # Node specification
    ├── executor.ts        # Execution logic
    ├── ui.vue            # Optional custom UI
    └── icon.svg          # Optional custom icon
```

See [Node Specification](docs/architecture/NODE_SPEC.md) for details.

## Design System

CLASP Flow follows a custom design system with:

- **Colors**: Teal primary (#2AAB8A), neutral grays, semantic colors
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono (monospace), industrial aesthetic
- **Style**: Sharp corners, offset shadows, uppercase labels
- **Icons**: Lucide icon library

See [design-system (1).html](design-system%20(1).html) for the full component library.

## Data Types

Connections are color-coded by data type:

| Type | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `trigger` | Orange | Event signals |
| `number` | Teal | Numeric values |
| `string` | Purple | Text data |
| `boolean` | Red | True/false |
| `audio` | Green | Audio buffers |
| `video` | Blue | Video frames |
| `texture` | Pink | WebGL textures |
| `data` | Gray | JSON objects |
