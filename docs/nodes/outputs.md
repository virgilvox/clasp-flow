## Main Output

Final output viewer with large preview.

### Info

Displays the final texture output as a large preview. Use this as the terminal node in any visual pipeline to see what your flow produces. Every flow that generates visuals should end with one of these.

**Tips:**
- Only one Main Output is needed per flow since additional instances will overwrite each other.
- Connect a blend node before this to layer multiple texture sources together.

**Works well with:** Shader, Blend, Webcam, Texture Display, Render 3D

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **ID** | `main-output` |
| **Icon** | `monitor-play` |
| **Version** | 1.0.0 |

### Inputs
| Port | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `texture` | `texture` | Texture to display |

### Outputs
*None*

### Controls
*None*

### Custom UI
This node has a custom Vue component (`MainOutputNode.vue`) that provides:
- Large preview canvas
- Fullscreen toggle
- Resolution display
- Frame rate indicator

### Implementation

The MainOutput node uses a specialized rendering approach to bypass Vue reactivity issues:

1. **Direct Engine Access**: Gets texture from `ExecutionEngine.getNodeTexture()` instead of Vue reactive store
2. **Canvas 2D Display**: Uses `ThreeShaderRenderer.renderToCanvas()` to copy GPU texture to 2D canvas
3. **Animation Loop**: Runs `requestAnimationFrame` loop when runtime is active

```typescript
// Simplified flow:
const engine = getExecutionEngine()
const texture = engine.getNodeTexture(nodeId) as THREE.Texture
const threeRenderer = getThreeShaderRenderer()
threeRenderer.renderToCanvas(texture, canvas)
```

This approach is necessary because Vue's reactivity system loses `THREE.Texture` object identity when converting Map to plain object via `Object.fromEntries()`.

The custom UI component provides a larger preview than standard nodes, making it ideal as the final destination in visual processing pipelines.

### Usage
Connect any texture-producing node to the Main Output to see the final result:

```
[Shader] → [Blur] → [Color Correction] → [Main Output]
```

The Main Output node is typically the terminus of visual processing chains. Only one Main Output should generally be active in a flow, though multiple can exist for A/B comparison during development.

## Output Philosophy

LATCH separates output destinations by media type:

| Media | Output Node | Category |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Visual/Texture | Main Output | outputs |
| Audio | Audio Output | audio |
| Data/Values | Monitor, Console | debug |
| External | HTTP, WebSocket, MIDI, etc. | connectivity |

This separation allows independent routing of different media streams and clear visualization of data flow in complex patches.
